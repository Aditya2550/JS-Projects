# JS-Projects

This repo contains my JavaScript projects!

Project 1:
-> It is a game named "Guess The Number".
-> The number guess is for numbers between 1 - 20.
-> You can play the game by putting the number of your choice inside the input field [?].
-> After putting the number, click the Guess button to see if the number is correct or not.

Project 2:
-> It is a Modal Window designed using JavaScript.
-> The Modal Window is used to display the message of details of the product on the screen.
-> It is opened by clicking on the button.
-> And it is closed by either clicking on the close button or clicking outside the window.

Project 3:
-> It is a game named "Pig game".
-> The game is played between two players.
-> Each player has to roll the dice to get the points.
-> While rolling the dice, if any player rolls 1, then the player loses the turn and the other player gets the chance to roll the dice.
-> In addition to this the player who has rolled 1 loses all the points he/she has earned so far (in that particular turn of dice roll).
-> After each roll, the player can choose to hold the points which are earned so far.
-> The points add up to the total points of the players.
-> The game ends when one of the player reaches 100 points.
