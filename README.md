## Project 3: Pig Game

- It is a game named "Pig Game".
- The game is played between two players.
- Each player has to roll the dice to get the points.
- If any player rolls 1, then the player loses the turn and the other player gets the chance to roll the dice.
- The player who rolls 1 loses all the points earned so far (in that particular turn).
- After each roll, the player can choose to hold the points earned so far.
- The points add up to the total points of the players.
- The game ends when one of the players reaches 100 points.
