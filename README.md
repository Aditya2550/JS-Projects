# JS-Projects

This repo contains my JavaScript projects!

Project 1:
-> It is a game Named Guess The Number.
-> The number guess is for numbers between 1 - 20.
-> You can play the game by putting the number of your choice inside the input field [?].
-> After putting the number, click the Guess button to see if the number is correct or not.

Project 2:
-> It is a Modal Window designed using JavaScript.
-> The Modal Window is used to display the message of details of the product on the screen.
-> It is opened by clicking on the button.
-> And it is closed by either clicking on the close button or clicking outside the window.
